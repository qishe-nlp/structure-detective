"I feel the cold on my hands.",
"She's one of the nomadic Dukha people.",
"Today they're on the move, heading to their spring camping ground.",
"Look, it snowed a lot.",
"Are we all here?",
"At night here the temperature can drop to minus 40.",
"It's a race to get the tents up before sunset...",
"and everyone must pull their weight.",
"Even little Enerkhein.",
"Isn't it long enough?",
"Take it, Eene.",
"This one?",
"You are a lovely girl.",
"A mother's child.",
"Ohh!",
"Give it to them.",
"There's one last job Enerkhein has to do.",
"Enerkhein.",
"Bring some snow, my daughter.",
"Collect snow to use for cooking dinner.",
"Get the snow from over there.",
"The cleanest snow is a long way from camp.",
"Ouch, my hand.",
"And on her own, it's tough work.",
"I cannot do it.",
"But she's realized it doesn't need to be so hard.",
"She goes to find her friend, Tismen.",
"Come here, please.",
"Let's carry the bucket together.",
"For the first time in her life,",
"Enerkhein has asked someone outside her family for help.",
"Shall we get the snow from over there?",
"For a fouryearold, it's a milestone.",
"The snow is beginning to melt here.",
"Have you taken good snow?",
"Enerkhein has figured out the importance of working with other people.",
"Put it over here.",
"Okay, we're done now.",
"That together, she can achieve more than she can alone.",

"You two children brought the snow.",
"You are good children to bring it for me.",
"Now I will cook for you.",
"Enerkhein is on an incredible journey that takes 2,000 days.",
"2,000 days, when we transform from a helpless newborn...",
"into the most capable creature on the planet.",
"Told through the eyes of 100 children around the world...",
"this is the extraordinary story...",
"of how we learn to talk...",
"move...",
"think...",
"and love.",
"Come on.",
"This time... Puddle!",
"how we build relationships.",
"From the enduring bonds we form with our family...",
"to the sophisticated skills we learn to make new friends.",
"If no one owns up, there will be no treats.",
"I did it.",
"Our childhood is when we discover that we are stronger together.",
"From the moment we're born...",
"until we've turned five.",
"2,000 days that are the secret... to becoming you.",
"In the Yaeda Valley, a group of Hadza men are on the hunt.",
"One of the oldest huntergatherer societies on Earth...",
"they can only survive here because of the strong bonds between them.",
"Bonds that begin to form soon after birth.",
"Be calm.",
"Eightweekold Mwishoni is the newest addition to the tribe.",
"Don't cry, don't cry now.",
"Until recently, like all newborns, she couldn't focus her eyes properly.",
"You're beautiful.",
"But now, at two months,",
"she's beginning to see the world more clearly...",
"allowing her to make and keep eye contact with those around her.",
"Do you see me?",
"In this intimate moment,",
"a powerful hormone is released in both Mwishoni and her mother...",
"producing feelings of calm, trust and togetherness...",
"cementing the bond between them.",
"Now your eyes have no tears.",
"We used to think babies could only form this special bond",
"with their mother.",
"This little girl.",
"Are you laughing?",
"But we now know",
"if other people spend enough time caring for Mwishoni and sharing eye contact...",
"Do you see me?",
"she can bond with them just as strongly.",
"As babies get older,",
"they discover there's an even more powerful way to connect with people.",
"Come on!",
"Fivemonthold Jesse",
"is celebrating his first Memorial Day with his family.",
"I'm just thinking the grill and that, like",
"Like all babies his age, faces are his favorite thing to look at.",
"And he wants as much attention from others as possible.",
"What?",
"Are you ready?",
"Hey.",
"Uhhuh, that's nice and cool right here.",
"But with so many people here, making eye contact isn't working.",
"Jesse needs a better trick.",
"Where's Nana?",
"And this time, it works immediately.",
"Hi.",
"Using his smile...",
"he can win over anyone and everyone.",
"You're so handsome.",
"Across the world...",
"babies quickly learn how to get and keep the attention of others.",
"Eye contact and smiling will come in useful all their lives.",
"Ahh.",
"But as they get older, babies won't always hand out their smiles so generously.",
"Back in San Antonio...",
"it's three months later.",
"Hi.",
"And a big day for Jesse.",
"Who's ready to get his hair cut?",
"How're you doing?",
"At eight months old, he's about to get his first haircut.",
"You all set?",
